fun little project I made while procrastinating studying.

edit preprocessors to configure
  a few different print options can be configured in print_settings.h
  set the preprocessors in main to configure what the program will do

run 
  cat test_data/even_odd.in test_data/even_odd.expect | ./perceptron 
to predict if 3 bit models are even or odd, and
  cat test_data/and.in test_data/and.expect | ./perceptron
for an and gate.

work in progress.
